## Vision and Mission

- **Vision:** Users and contributors to ADR assets leading inclusive, professional and sustainable communities.
- **Mission:** Delivering focused training, facilitating collaboration, and fostering collaborative networks that enable administrative data researchers and ADR to excel in building and managing effective research communities.

## About

ADR England is beginning to see the establishment of research communities associated with data sets, problems and interest areas relevant to ADR UK data assets. 
The emergence of communities has been both organic and intentionally seeded by investments such as the [community catalyst funds](https://www.adruk.org/news-publications/news-blogs/funding-opportunity-adr-england-research-community-catalysts/).
Next, ADR want to explore the potential to support the sustainability of relevant communities as part of the support provided for the wider body of admin data users.  

One mechanism to support this is to engage with existing and aspiring community leaders utilising the expertise of RCM Cooperative.
 
## Roadmap & Milestones

- **Goals:** 
    - Understand the needs of administrative data communities
    - Provide training to community leaders

- **Outcomes:** 
    - Recommendations for ADR UK as to how we might support community leaders going forwards 
    - Increased capapcity for community leadership
    - Alignment of communities across the ADR network
