## Purpose of these sessions

### What we want to achieve (objectives) 

- Start to build a network of ADR UK community leaders.
- Start to build out a set of recommendations for how ADR UK can support the health and sustainability of their communities, aligned with ADR UK goals.
- Deliver training in community management principles ("RCM 101") to provide a backbone context to recommendations.
- Provide some experiential learning of equitable collaboration.

### How we want participants to feel (format and tone) 

- You are leaders in the development of ADR UKs recommendations.
- This is supported co-creation - you are being facilitated to contribute your expert knowledge.
- You are at the start of something, building strong new relationships which will continue to add value to your community organising.
- You are empowered to continue to collaborate on this project to deliver final recommendations.
- Your contributions are valued by ADR UK.

## Miro board activities

We will be working collaboratively on a custom Miro board, to enable flexible collection and integration of your expertise. 
To make the most of our workshop time, it would be beneficial for you to access and familiarise yourself with the board before our meeting.

### Accessing the Miro board

You will receive an email invitation to access the Miro board. 
Please follow the instructions in the email from Miro to interact with the material.

### Zoomed out view

On the bottom right of your web browser, you will see the zoom control as shown below.

![miro zoom buttons](../assets/miro-zoom-button.png)<br>
*Figure 1. Miro zoom control on the bottom right of your web browser. Click “+” to zoom in and “-“ to zoom out.*

Initially, we suggest you zoom out so you can see all five “Frames” on the board. In this workshop, we will be focusing on Frames 1-3. We will return to Frames 4 and 5 five in our next session.

![miro view of all frames in the board](../assets/miro-full-board.png)<br>
*Figure 2. Zoomed out view of all Miro “Frames”. Frames 1-3 will be used in this online workshop.*

During the workshop we will be reviewing the feedback already provided by yourselves and earlier groups on your vision for ADR communities, and how we can support participation of your colleagues (“post-its” on Frame 1-3).

Each post-it represents a keyword extracted from feedback. Each keyword is only included once per contributor, therefore the frequency of each keyword is indicative of how many people referenced that issue in their feedback.

After we have reached collective agreement and understanding of the themes identified, we will prioritise which aspects can be practically taken forwards to develop recommendations for the sustainability of ADR communities (voting using the “stars” on Frame 1-3).

We will return to Frames 4 and 5 in our next workshop.

## Slack

We will use the RCM Cooperative Slack Workspace to for informal conversations between participants before, during and after these workshops. 
This is a space for you to connect around issues relating to the management of research communities.

You will have a private channel for participants in this workshop (#adr-community-leaders), and access to the other public channels in the workspace.

If you are not familiar with using Slack, you may find this [Quick Start Guide from The Turing
Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/communication-channels/slack-start-guide)
